## Abstract

- However, previous **endeavors to** (connect separate monolingual word embeddings) typicaly require (cross-lingual signals as supervision), either in the form of (parallel corpus or seed lexicon).
  e.g., 
 
- We **carry out evaluation on** the (unsupervised bilingual lexicon induction) task. Even though this task appears intrinsically (cross-lingual), we are able to demonstrate encouraging performance without any (cross-lingual) clues.
  e.g., 

## Introduction

- Soon following the success on (monolingual tasks), the potential of (word embeddings for cross-lingual natural language processing) has **attracted much attention**. In their pioneering work, (). 

- The interesting findings is **in line with** research on human cognition (Youn et al., 2016).

- **This is unfortunate for low-resource languages and domains, because data encoding cross-lingual equivalence is often expensive to obtain.**

- The generator aims to make the transformed embeddings not only indistinguishable by the discriminator, but also recoverable as measured by the reconstruction loss $$ \mathcal{L}_{r} $$.
