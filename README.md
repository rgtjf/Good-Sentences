## Abstract

- However, previous **endeavors to** (connect separate monolingual word embeddings) typicaly require (cross-lingual signals as supervision), either in the form of (parallel corpus or seed lexicon).
  e.g., 
 
- We **carry out evaluation on** the (unsupervised bilingual lexicon induction) task. Even though this task appears intrinsically (cross-lingual), we are able to demonstrate encouraging performance without any (cross-lingual) clues.

## Introduction

- Soon following the success on (monolingual tasks), the potential of (word embeddings for cross-lingual natural language processing) has **attracted much attention**. In their pioneering work, (). 

- The interesting findings is **in line with** research on human cognition (Youn et al., 2016).

- **This is unfortunate for low-resource languages and domains, because data encoding cross-lingual equivalence is often expensive to obtain.**

- The generator aims to make the transformed embeddings not only indistinguishable by the discriminator, but also recoverable as measured by the reconstruction loss $ \mathcal{L}_{R} $.

## Related Work

- **In contrast, our work completely removes the need for** cross-lingual signals **to** connect monolingual word embeddings, trained on non-parallel text corpora.

## Model Description

## Experiments Analysis

- Generative adversarial networks are **notoriously difficult** to train, and investigation into stabler training **remains a research frontier** (Radford et al., 2015; Salimans et al., 2016; Ar..).

## Conclusion

- **In this work, we demonstrate** the feasibility of connecting word embeddings of different languages without any cross=lingual signal. **This is achived by** matching the distributions of the transformed source language embeddings and target ones via adversarial training. **The success of our approach signifies** the existence of universal lexical semantic structure across languages. **Our work also open up opportunities for** the processing of extrmely low-resource languages and domains that lack parallel data completely.
