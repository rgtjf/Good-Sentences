## Low-resource STS

### Abstract
- ``A`` is a challenging research problem with practical applications.
- To do ..., this work proposes to ... . In particular, we ... .
- The plausibility of our model is demonstrated by extensive experimental results. / The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model can effectively improve the performance in low-resource scenarios.

### Introduction
- Background -> previous work -> questions/disadvantage -> in this work -> main contributions

- ``A`` is an essential basis of natural language understanding. The study of ``A`` can be of great benefit to many Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR) applications, including machine translation \cite{zou2013bilingual}, question answering \cite{wang2016inner,mlan2016QA}, and text summarization \cite{mihalcea2004textrank,nagwani2011frequent}.

- The advantage of deep learning models is that they can automatically learn the features, without relying on specific domain knowledge.

- not a big deal for

- ``A`` suffers from less annotated data for ... and the lack of handy NLP tools for feature engineering.

- lead to deteriorate overall performance.

-  conveniently obtain/acquire 

- we train two neural networks jointly, one for the low-resource language STS ({\it i.e.}, the main task), and the other for the resource-rich language STS ({\it i.e.}, the auxiliary task).
