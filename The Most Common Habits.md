## Section 2

1. Some words have identical singular and plural forms and do not need an s added on to make them plural
2.
3.
4. Never begin an English sentence with abbreviations and Arabic numerals such as Fig. and 8. Instead write Figure and Eight.
5. Do not write ‘by this way’. Instead write ‘by doing this’, or ‘using this method’.
6. Never write ‘How to…’ at the beginning of a sentence. (Don’t say it either.)
```
No
How to find the optimal parameter is the main objective.
Yes
Determining how to find the optimal parameter is the main objective.
```
7. Do write ‘the results are shown in Figure 2’. Do not write ‘the results are showed as Figure 2’.
8. Italicize variables appearing in the text to differentiate them from words. This is especially important when the variables are English alphabets. Write ‘The graph shows t, a, and C as a function of time’. Do not write ‘The graph shows t, a, and C as a function of time’.
9. Refrain from using the word obviously in a technical paper in the following way
```
No
Obviously, detecting regimes by means of PMH maps is a novel method.8
Yes
Detecting regimes by means of PMH maps is a novel method.8
```
10. International papers should not use location dependant terms such as ‘at home’, ‘abroad’, ‘here’, ‘our country’ because the reader most likely is not Chinese and not in China. Instead, write ‘in China’.
11. Avoid overusing the phrases ‘that is to say’ and ‘namely’. Instead, try to convey your meaning in one sentence.
12. Do not use ‘too’ at the end of a written sentence, especially in a technical paper.
