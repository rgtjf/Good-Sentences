- Case 1: A 比 B 好

> [A] outperforms [B]. INFERENCE.

> No matther [what kind of word representation is taken], [A] achieves substantially higher performance over [B]. INFERENCE.

> INFERENCE: This demonstrates the importance of ... 

> INFERENCE: It/Which proves that ... / the effective of [A] in doing ...

> INFERENCE: Which indicates that [A] does help to do ...

> INFERENCE: This is because ...

- Case 2: A + B 更好

> the integration of [A] and [B] performs better than any of the [A \cap B]. INFERENCE.

> INFERENCE: That is, [A] is able to do ... and [B] takes the ... into consideration, which is crucial to ...
